# Python Hands-On Lab Programs

This repository contains my Python hands-on lab programs developed during my practical coursework.  
It includes implementations of core Python concepts, data handling, logic building, and basic applications written during lab sessions.

## Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and indentation  
- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)  
- Looping constructs (for, while)  
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- String handling and built-in functions  
- Functions, parameters, and return values  
- Modules and importing  
- File handling (read/write operations)  
- Exception handling  
- Basic problem-solving programs  
- Simple object-oriented programming (classes, objects, methods)

## How to Run the Programs

1. Install Python 3.x.  
2. Open any `.py` file in your preferred IDE or text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook).  
3. Run the program using one of the following:

   Using the terminal:
   ```bash
   python FileName.py
   
Using VS Code or PyCharm:
Open the file
Click "Run" or use the integrated terminal

Purpose:
To document my Python lab practice
To demonstrate hands-on experience in Python programming
To strengthen core Python fundamentals
To build a foundation for data analysis, automation, and advanced Python development
